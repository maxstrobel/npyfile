"""Package for writing continuously NpyFiles.

This package contains an implementation to write continuously to a ``.npy``
file. It is useful if single slices of an array are available sequentially,
i.e. from a live camera that delivers images over time, or do not fit into the
memory.

The `Numpy file format`_ is a simple binary format with a header followed by the
actual data.
